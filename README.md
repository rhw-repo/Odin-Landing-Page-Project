# Odin-Landing-Page-Project

This was a project to recreate a specific design as part of The Odin Project's Foundation Flexbox  module. It's a dummy landing page for an imaginary business, 
with images from Unsplash and Pexels. 

None of the links lead to another page, the idea is simply to work with HTML and CSS (including lots of Flexbox) to create a layout.
